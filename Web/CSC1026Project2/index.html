					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>
						Hello! Thank you for visiting this site! <br>
						This was created by me (Arron Rawstron) to aid those wanting to learn all about HTML and CSS. This website will give you a way to learn a little about the history, theory and also how to code your own website. This website is intended to be either brief revision of key points or a brief overview of the basics. This is not an indepth explanation on the details of everything. <br>
						This site starts at the very basics, so if your quite familiar with HTML and CSS, this website may not provide much information that is new to you. However, it's always a good idea to return to basics now and again.
						For those who are completely new to making websites, I encourage you to look over the material first, then testing your knowledge using the quizes. <br>
						Now, enough talking. Feel free to explore to site and learn all about websites.
						If you need anything, feel free to contact me either via Phone during office hours (GMT), via email or using the submission form. <br>
						Thanks for reading!
