This program was made by Arron Rawstron
To use, run the main class and this will display onscreen instructions in the console.
These instructions should be fairly self explanatory.

In terms of file placement, the large and small file should already be placed in the root of the project
(with the .project file)
Should you want to use your own, you will be able to do so using the menu when running the program.
Do this by selecting custom file and typing in the ENTIRE file path.
E.g. D:\Arron\Documents\TestFiles\data\customFile.txt

The instruction for the GUI can also be found below:
The 3 boxes represent the forename, surname an telephone extension.
For each of the options, insert, delete, get number and edit, certain values will be required
These are as follows:
	Insert - Forename AND Surname AND Telephone Extension
	Delete - Surname OR Telephone Extension
	Get Number - Surname
	Edit - Surname AND Telephone Extension
Then press the button to complete the action
The table will update automatically
Any errors will show below the buttons along with any output required (Get Num)
